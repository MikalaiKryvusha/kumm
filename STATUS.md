# KUMM — Current Status

> This file is read by the AI agent before every task. Update it on every significant change of state.
> It is the PRIMARY handoff between sessions: a new agent session starts with empty context and must be
> able to get productive from this file alone. Write accordingly — concrete, with file paths and commands.
> 🧠 Prime thinking principle — `PHILOSOPHY.md` (SIMPLICITY: KISS + Occam). Read your working framework
> in `AGENT_GUIDE.md`.
>
> ⚠️ **STATUS is a SUMMARY of NOW, not a chronicle.** A status file that only ever grows turns into
> the project's history book, and the agent that came for a quick "where are we" drowns in it
> (field: a 2 300-line STATUS — "an abyss, not a summary"). The rules that keep it a summary:
>
> - **Every line passes two tests:** *"if I remove this line, will the next agent make a mistake?"*
>   and *"does a newcomer still read the whole file in one sitting?"* Soft target: **~200 lines**
>   (one-two screens of substance) — the guard is a warning, not a wall, but crossing it means a
>   trim is overdue.
> - **Closed work is MOVED OUT, not accumulated:** when a phase/session's entry is no longer "now",
>   move it VERBATIM into `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` (the chronicle — that is what it is for).
>   `/end-chat-soft` carries a "bonsai trim" step for exactly this (`/pause` stays ceremony-free by design).
> - **Leave the file the way you'd want to find it:** fresh summary of what works, what's in
>   progress, what's next, the pitfalls, and WHERE TO LOOK for the details (plans, bugs, history) —
>   pointers, not retellings.

## What's done (the short tail — older entries live in PROJECT_HISTORY.md)

> 07–08.10, Medieval Dynasty up to the pause, Svarog 09.10–10.10 — chronicle, entries 2026-10-10 03:38, 2026-10-10 16:31, 2026-10-11 00:46.

## Where we are now

> 🎯 **The Conan 3.0.1 build is the main work since 2026-10-26 ≈08:30; every other game is out of priority.** `[OWNER]` «все игры пока не в приоритере, мы
> работаем дат сборкой конана» · «она 1_ должна работать стабильно 2_ моды не должны конфликтовать, должны быть рабочими 3_ не должно быть
> явных просадок производительности из-за модов» · 2026-10-26. Work order — "Where to continue", item 0.
>
> 🆕 **Conan 3.1.0 is out (2026-11-12, Part Three of the Giant-Kings arc); the build still lives on 3.0.1, the new game is NOT downloaded.** Web recon 2026-11-13 09:09 —

> UE4SS on the new exe; the kit revision. No staff known-issues list yet, players wait for a hotfix — when to move is the owner's call.
>
> **Svarog's Dream — the main work from 2026-10-09 to 2026-10-26** (`[OWNER]` «забей на Medieval Dynasty … мы работаем дальше над Сварогом» · 2026-10-09 ≈13:25;
> scale: 16:9 at 720p, 1080p, 2K, 4K — `MASTER_PLAN.md`). Medieval Dynasty is paused; the paragraph below is for the return.
>
> **Medieval Dynasty (paused)** — pack `D:/work/ai_sandbox/MedievalDynasty`, epic 15 (`plans/15_…`, phase 0 — `plans/16_…`),
> bug 29 (HDR) open; return checklist — chronicle, entries 2026-10-09 19:41 and 2026-10-10 03:38.

> **Svarog's Dream** — dossier `games/SvarogsDream/README.md`, backlog `plans/18_svarog_backlog_checklist.md`. Run rules — `HOUSE_RULES_REFERENCE.md`

> **Mafia II** — paused, dossier `games/Mafia2/README.md` (section «Дальше»); the agent does not start the story.
>
> **Conan 2.2.3** — dossier `games/ConanExiles/README.md`. Palworld — in daily use, no edits pending.
> **Oblivion Remastered is parked until its patch** — do not go there until the owner says so.
> **Cyberpunk 2077 — no game installed (removed 2026-10-30 by the owner's word).** The pack repo `D:/work/ai_sandbox/Cyberpunk2077`

The engine works and the owner uses it daily for Palworld. It checks its pure core (the first test since 2026-09-08, four since 2026-10-14):
`node test-parse-archive.mjs`, `test-archive-roundtrip.mjs`, `test-pick-card.mjs`, `test-help-commands.mjs` (exit 0 = green), and the game
half runs on a fake pack — `node tools/fixture-pack.mjs` (`-ListMods`, `-Deploy -DryRun`, a real `-Deploy` and `-Verify`, paks after `-Only`:
37 checks since 2026-11-01 — the undo journal, the player's uninstaller, the desktop shortcut; all 37 passed on 2026-11-01). Not covered yet: the live Nexus path (Chrome) — Phase 1 in `MASTER_PLAN.md`.

| Phase | Status | What's there |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Phase 0 — the two halves | ✅ done | v0.1.0 in daily use |
| Phase 1 — trustworthy unattended | 🟡 in progress | 2026-10-14: four regression tests of the pure core + launch guard + fixture stand; 2026-10-15: the stand deploys and runs `-Verify` (20 checks, bug 46 DONE); Engine.ini runtime-cvar warning — first slice 2026-10-30 |
| Phase 2 — the second game | 🟢 **proven on Conan** | the engine took Conan Exiles Enhanced **without a single edit**: slug `conanexilesenhanced` from the manifest, `game_id` from the page. Oblivion Remastered stays prepared (manifest of 168 mods), waits for its patch |
| Phase 3 — compatibility | 🔲 todo | the conflict source is found: `UnrealPak -List` from the Dev Kit reads any Oodle pak (`researches/conan-devkit/`); the work — phase 3 of epic `plans/06` |
| Phase 4 — optimization presets | 🔲 todo | |

## 🤖 Autonomous backlog pool (no human / no special hardware needed)

> Tasks the agent can do FULLY autonomously: write code → build → test on the harness → fix → commit,
> without the human and without resources only the human can provide. The loop skills
> (`/autoloop`, `/dayloop`, `/nightloop`) grind this pool.

- Done pool items (launch guard, archive-name round trip, `pickCard` cases, the `help` command, the 20-check fixture pack) — chronicle,
  entries 2026-10-14 23:22 and 2026-10-16 23:39.
- [x] **Warn when a mod overrides `Engine.ini` at runtime** — FIRST SLICE DONE 2026-10-30 16:3x: `-Verify` warns «<Mod> sets <cvar>=<v> at runtime (<file>:<line>); the pack's Engine.ini sets <v>» for `source.folder` mods (report `testcases/reports/2026-10-30_engine-ini-runtime-cvar-warning.md`; next slices: archives / Workshop paks, blueprint bytecode). Both ailments of 21.08 were invisible to the engine:
      the deploy checked every file and still shipped a build whose graphics a Lua mod rewrites in the world.
      A cheap first slice needs no running game: scan the mods' sources for
      `[SystemSettings]` and `r.*` assignments and report which collide with the pack's `Engine.ini`.
      Field arguments (Palworld `r.ViewDistanceScale` in four places; in Conan the rival is the game itself) — chronicle,
      entry 2026-10-06 23:38, section «Доводы к пункту Engine.ini».
- [ ] **Rewrite old Russian working documents in English when taken into work** (plans, bugs, researches, game maps) — the owner's word
      2026-10-28; the KAIF entry documents were rewritten the same evening.

## ❓ Awaiting human review (interviews / homework)

- ✉️ **Nexus quarantine of mod 65 (0.9.0) — the THIRD letter is written 2026-11-13 09:09** (`[OWNER]` 09:03 «давай писать третье письмо»): `D:\Games\Conan Exiles Mods\Krinik_Mod_Pack_0_9_0_Nexus\nexus_support_quarantine_followup_2.txt`,
  a reply in ticket 276571; the three SHA-256 in it re-hashed from the release zip (match). The owner sends it.
- ✅ The pack's code of the evening chat 2026-11-10 + bug 93 build 7 — committed and pushed 2026-11-13 10:5x (pack `d3e92f9`, 5 judge rounds, the last clean).
- ✅ **the «+» brightness (plan 49)** — decided 13:41 G1 (Conan gold `#E9C27A`), confirmed 19:11 with the page arrows in the same style; TO BUILD (handover item 4).
- ✅ bug 91 — the owner picked V1 13:04 (a plate above the diamond); built in the kit, deployed 13:12 (pack `eef82bf`); the real-hover check waits for a free PC.
- (done) **2026-11-10 12:49 +03:00 — the look of the corruption «+» hover label (bug 91), the owner's pick of four** — review folder `НА ОТСМОТР НИКОЛАЕМ/81_podpis_oskverneniya`
  (`chto_smotret.md`; mockup `ConanExiles/_config/mockups/corruption_label_mockup.py`): V1 a plate above the diamond · V2 under it · V3 the game's place with a plate ·
  V4 no label. To show him when he is free (he was at the keyboard at 12:5x); then the kit edit of `W_Attribute`'s `CorruptionLabel` branch.

- ❓ **2026-11-07 07:4x — the hub controller's player-path test needs the game in FRONT** (real mouse clicks on the tabs, Esc/Tab closing, a 144 fps recording
  of the switches): the work of plan 48 runs background-only by the owner's word of 2026-11-06 23:32 <!-- attribution-ok: verbatim in plans/48 --> — SUPERSEDED 2026-11-07 13:46 by the owner (the machine is the agent's, the game may go to the front — verbatim in bug 67 DONE, STATUS chronicle entry). The section is proven
  by the remote's switches only.

> Decisions the agent must not make alone (brand/UX/architecture), or actions only the human can do
> (test on real hardware, external accounts). Filed in `interviews/` and `homeworks/`.

- ✅ **2026-11-02 00:22 — interview #030 APPLIED and seen (packs `0663f2f`, `fb6cc6a`):** arrows sit in the body (side frame, folder 56 `04_…`), one arrow per shaft
      in the corpse's loot, the shafts go when the arrows are taken (real E + Q) — TC A11, A12, A13 pass. **00:27 the Damage Meter page in the Xevyr hub works** (pack `dd73239`):
      D1, D2 pass (the author's values; a real Save writes the mod's slot through the author's window, which now closes after it), D3 flash not measured;
      the remote opens the Xevyr hub by the shared variable `KrinikHubRequest`. Next: the other four Xevyr pages (I6.3), then the list's Xevyr entry → the hub;
      ~~the left-list seam (the name mid-height)~~ FIXED 2026-11-02 07:34 +03:00 (cases L0–L2, report `2026-11-02_conan-hub-left-list-seam.md`); then the 13 blocks to 1.0.0.
- ⚠️ **CHAT 70dda2b5 FORCE-CLOSED 2026-11-02 00:31 +03:00 at 85.5 % (the hook's number).** Last step NOT done: the left-list seam fix (`SC_KrinikMods.Slot:SetVerticalAlignment(1)`
      in `fill_window`) left the hub window EMPTY in game (frame 00:30) — reverted to `dd73239` and redeployed; the cause is not read (check UE4SS.log for the
      fill error first). **Resolved 2026-11-02 07:3x:** the empty window was opened during the world load (log «module opened, but no visible …»), not the edit; the real
      cause of the seam — the hidden pages' list rows stayed (32 units each); `fill_window` now collapses `HB_KrinikModItem_<key>`. Game closed, machine lock released, everything pushed. Закрыто принудительно: церемонии (проход судьи, обрезка STATUS, README, линтеры
      витрины) пропущены — долг платит первый /end-chat-soft. Ложных утверждений на месте не осталось.
- (superseded) 🟡 **2026-11-02 00:02 +03:00 — the loot part BUILT (pack `0663f2f`):** arrows sit in the body (no shafts in the air — the owner's 23:46 frame fixed), one arrow per
      shaft goes into the corpse's loot (seen 4/4), a real Q takes them; the shafts go after a real Q — seen 00:10 (TC A13 pass); owed: a clean side frame of the shafts in a body (A11).
- (was) 🔴 **OWNER'S DEBT — interview #030 answered 2026-11-01 23:41 — A:** `[OWNER]` «тогда делаем, что воткнытые в трум стрелы идут в инвентарь трупа». To apply, in
      order: (1) a read-only remote recon of the corpse's inventory — its component class and the add-item UFunction (`scratchpad` probe `corpse_probe.lua` lists
      the corpse's components; `pult.sh "funcs <component>"`); (2) KrinikConanArchery `on_corpse_born` / `rebirth`: one arrow item (`ProjectileItemTemplateID` of
      the copy) into the corpse's loot per copy kept; (3) when the arrows leave the loot (`QuickLootPanel:SlotItemAddedOrRemoved`), the shafts go; cases in
      `TC_conan_arrows_stay_in_corpse_2026-11-01.md`. Not built yet.
- 🎯 **Oblivion-style archery — raised by the owner 2026-10-28** (a discussion, not work: `[OWNER]` «пока обсуждаем»): arrow speed — Conan's,
      the drop — Oblivion's. Vanilla `ArrowGravityScale` 0.55 and `ArrowInitialSpeedMultiplier` 5000 (Remastered) found; waits for his choice of what
      the draw does (shot power, as in Remastered, or a flatter flight, as in Conan). Recon — `researches/conan-archery/README.md`.
- 🧹 Disk cleanup 2026-10-25 — the "your call" items of `C:\REVISIONS\…_ИТОГ.md`, `D:\REVISIONS\…_ИТОГ.md` are the owner's (chronicle, 2026-10-25 22:15).
- 🔴 **Do NOT run `Clear-Quarantine.ps1 -Stamp 2026-08-17_2335 -Execute`**: the quarantine holds the only
      copy of an Elden Ring save and the personal video `ref.mp4`.
- 🗂️ **Old questions to the owner** (cleanup 17.08 — malware, RTSS, iTunes, quarantine; Palworld `LoadingRange` 25600 — what to restore;
      Oblivion — mod-list rows and reshades; the "not a Steam install" line and the anonymisation rule) — chronicle, entry 2026-10-12 19:22.
- 🧰 Anything needing a real Nexus login, a real game install, or the owner's own mod pack is his to
      run — the agent can build the fixture path but cannot verify the live path alone.

## Where to continue next session

> A concrete checklist so the next session (empty context) can start immediately: which files, which

>   - **Sprint with the bow drawn — BUILT** (`KrinikConanLocomotion` section `krinik_bow_sprint.lua`, manifest verify line): the game's movement row table and
>     `EvaluateMovementType` read (game map «The movement row»); levers: native `K2_CanSprint` post-hook + `EvaluateMovement_RangeCombat` → false under ONE gate.
>     Real input on builds 1–2: sprint 735 with the draw kept, a shot on the run fired. Build 3 (after judge round 1, 8 of 10 findings fixed) is deployed; only S0 and

>      must show NO substate 7. Then judge round 3 if round 2 had confirmed findings.
>   2. The KrinikConanUI key binds (recon F1) — the fix route is a choice: game-thread clicks only while our window / menu is shown (poll `WasInputKeyJustPressed` while
>      shown) vs the hero's AnyKey event (Camera pattern, gameplay keys only). Ask the owner in one line if not obvious; the feedback plate's LMB first (fires on every shot).

> **Older pointer blocks (2026-10-26 … 2026-11-02: chat FIRST lists, the 1.0.0 orders, plan 35/36/34 queues, the measurement queue) — moved verbatim to the chronicle, entry 2026-11-03 20:58 +03:00 (second part).** The live backlog: the guide chapter «Известные проблемы и планы на 1.0.0», epics `plans/40_…` and `plans/41_…`, `plans/36_…` (W table), `plans/35_…`, `plans/34_…`; work trees `_paksview-3.0.1` (66 GB) and `Conan Exiles Mods/_text-extract-3.0.1` (20 GB) stay.

## Open bugs

Files without the DONE tag — 29 (2026-10-18 13:45):

- 🔴 `bugs/64_conan_mod_ui_wave_overlaps_untranslated.md` — the UI of the Conan 3.0.1 build's mods, 26 items: open 4, 5, 6, 12, 13 (partly),
  15 (🟡 hub controller in the build), 16–18, 23 (EAA class cards — text in textures), 26 (late emblem in the hub); closed by a frame 2, 3, 7, 21 (4K, 2026-11-07), 7b, 8 (again 2026-10-31 at 1080p, list 540), 9–11,
  14, 16, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25 — work order in plan 35.
- 🔧 `bugs/85_conan_crash_keybind_lua_races_game_thread.md` — the bow-kill crash: cause fixed in Archery + Camera; the KrinikConanUI twins open; the owner's gameplay is the check.
- 🔴 `bugs/89_conan_water_reflection_flicker.md` — 2026-11-09 15:45, the owner's frame at `river_bend`: dark dashes / grain blinking over the water, «как тени листвы пальм»; after plan 51.
- 🔴 `bugs/86_…` (attribute tree caption under a node icon), `bugs/87_…` (beasts walk into the hero), `bugs/88_…` (corruption debuff line fonts) — 2026-11-07, the owner's frames.
- 🔴 The owner's bugs 55–62 (2026-10-18 13:35–13:43, a wave in 5 minutes of play) — `bugs/55_…` – `bugs/62_…`; order and plan 32 — item 00000 above.

- ⏸ Bugs of paused games (Svarog, GTA SA, Medieval Dynasty) — 15, 28, 29, 38, 40, 41, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54: files in `bugs/`, summary — chronicle, entry 2026-10-28 23:10.

- 🔧 `bugs/14_pickcard_exact_name_pins_old_file.md` (fixed 2026-10-15, waits for a live `kumm check`) — `kumm check` holds on to an old file if the author once
  put the version into the file name (Bosses My New Besties, 02.10). A bug of the engine itself; the fix plan and the case are in the document.
- 🟡 `bugs/07_conan_probe_kills_ue4ss_lua_layer.md` — the symptom removed by turning the mod off, the cause not found.
- ✅ Camera jitter at rest, the menu abort, the config file overriding the camera code — DONE 2026-10-29 by the owner's word («давно исправлено»).

## KAIF — feedback and tickets

KAIF 2.9 since 2026-10-16 (from 2.7 in one step; report `reports/KAIF_UPDATES/KUMM_KAIF_2.9_UPDATE_REPORT.md`): project facts — in
`HOUSE_RULES.md`, the KAIF hooks are wired in `.claude/settings.json` (the client reads them at session start). KAIF feedback — without asking
the owner (`AGENT_GUIDE.md` → Notes from the human, his word of 18.09). Tickets #72, #73, #78–#82 closed by the origin in 2.8 (`bugs/KAIF/03–08_DONE_*`);
open: #140 (`bugs/KAIF/09_*`, the origin moved it to 2.10) and three tickets of that update — #150–#152 (`bugs/KAIF/10–12_*`).
#179 (`bugs/KAIF/19_*`, 2026-10-28): `/resume` costs ≈ 140 k tokens (measured 2026-10-29 10:08 by the transcript `usage`: 64 k → 181 k = 117 k,
`EXPERIENCE.md` grepped by tag, not read whole) — proposed: read each document's "entry slice" at entry; rules as statements
without rationale (the owner's word, in the ticket's comments); until the origin decides, the ritual reads everything. Since 2026-10-28 the hook
`.claude/hooks/context-budget.mjs` runs (2026-10-30: #181 farewell hook, #182 autonomy guard, #183 the agent cleans up after itself — `bugs/KAIF/21–23`): at 70 % and 75 % — warnings only (the owner 2026-10-31 21:26), at 85 % — the closure (`CLAUDE.md`).
