# TESTING_FRAMEWORK — how the agent tests what it creates

Raw generated content — code, a document, an analysis, anything — **must not be trusted**. It may *look*
logical and working and still be broken, or fail the owner's actual requirements (the idea, the plan, the
vision). An early defect that rides silently to production is the most expensive kind — it destroys
projects from the inside. Testing is a distinct, first-class part of ALL work, not a formality after it.
This document is the agent's testing canon; it applies to **every artifact in every sphere** — a function,
a dataset, a legal clause, a bridge design, a thought (what "verify" means in your sphere is defined by
the project's sphere library: its *Verification by observation* and *Minimum evidence set* sections).

## The seven principles of testing (the canon)

1. **Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence.** A green suite never proves the product
   has no bugs — bugs ALWAYS exist; testing lowers the risk, never to zero.
2. **Exhaustive testing is impossible.** You cannot check every input/state combination — prioritize by
   risk and value instead of pretending completeness.
3. **Early testing saves the budget.** Verify at the requirements/plan stage; the later a defect is
   found, the more it costs (the waterfall skyscraper on an untested foundation).
4. **Defects cluster.** Most bugs live in a few narrow modules — where one was found, hunt for more
   (the fable-method twin check is this principle mechanized).
5. **The pesticide paradox.** The same tests stop finding new bugs — vary the tests, angles, and data.
6. **Testing is context-dependent.** Methods are chosen per project and sphere — a payment system, a
   research paper, and a landing page are not tested alike.
7. **The absence-of-errors fallacy.** A defect-free product that does not solve the user's task is
   worthless — always test against the OWNER'S requirements (`GOAL.md`, the idea, the plan), not only
   against the code's own consistency.

## What the word "test" means — a functional run on the real product, by the user's path

The word was never defined, and a session used it honestly while the owner read it as false (origin
issue #62: "25 closed, all tested" on unit · self-test · mutant, recounted by the owner-QA as **3 of
25**). The owner then defined "by hand" for an AI agent (decision #116, rendered): it writes itself the
scenarios from the functionality of the module, the feature, the fixed bug, writes itself the machinery,
and in the real product — stage or production — walks the application: presses the buttons, reads the
lines, looks at the screen, reads the logs — as a QA would by hand. So:

1. **A test is a functional run on the REAL product (stage or production), by the user's path, whose
   result is READ.** The agent derives the scenarios from the functionality under test (the chain
   below), writes the machinery that walks them (a browser driver, a CLI session, a log reader) and runs
   it as the user would, READING the screen, the lines, the logs; never "the owner will test" — his eye judges taste.
2. **Hygiene is not a test.** Lint, unit tests, self-tests, mutation proofs, guards — mandatory (gate 5
   stays), never called "testing" in a report, a marker or a handover: they prove the check can fail, not
   that the thing works for a person. Machinery that returns only an exit code is an instrument, not a
   test: a run is a test when its result was read, and the report says what.
3. **`[NOT-TESTED]` is inadmissible to production.** Marker rule 2 flips on a functional run only; the
   run report carries it SEPARATE from hygiene (`Hygiene:` · `Functional run:` — never summed; `NONE` =
   *fixed, not tested*); a bug's closing status carries the same two lines (`/report-bug`).

## The testing activities — the chain that makes "tested" mean something

The trust contract below says how much to TRUST a result; this section says how the testing WORK
is done. Field-paid reason for its existence (origin issue #21): with no obligation to design the
observation set, an agent ran ONE happy path, reported the feature as working, and the owner
produced five uncovered cases in about a minute. Testing a feature is a chain of activities, not
one observation — walk it in order, each step with its exit condition:

1. **Analyze the test basis.** Name the source of truth for the expected behaviour — a
   requirement, the owner's word, a spec, the canon map (`REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md` shapes
   these). *Exit:* every claim under test quotes where its expectation comes from; an expectation
   that is missing or untestable goes back as a requirements defect (principle 3 — cheapest right
   here). Studying the requirements to derive the test basis IS a testing activity, not somebody
   else's chapter.
2. **Design the observation set by named techniques.** Derive the cases with the standard
   instruments: equivalence partitioning · boundary values · decision tables · state transitions ·
   pairwise · use-case walk · error guessing. *Exit:* a written case list whose DIMENSIONS are
   named — which partitions, boundaries and states are covered, and which are consciously not
   (principle 2: prioritize by risk, and SAY what was left out).
3. **Write the documentation before executing.** Test documentation lives in files, never in the
   session's head: a plan (what and why) · a suite / checklist (the ordered set) · cases (steps ·
   expected · status). Copy the shipped template into the project's test-doc home (default
   `testcases/`, created on first use; the sphere or the project may name another):
   `cp .kaif/_testcases-template.md testcases/TC_<feature>_<slug>.md` — an artifact class with no
   home and no shape does not get written.
4. **Execute with bookkeeping.** Every case ends in a status — `pass` · `fail` · `blocked` ·
   `skipped` — with the observation named (what ran, what was seen). *Exit:* no case without a
   status; coverage is the case list, never an impression.
5. **Run the control case before calling the feature working.** Turn the controlling flag off /
   remove the controlling parameter and observe the feature NOT work: a feature check that cannot
   fail proves nothing (gate 5 below, applied at feature level).
6. **File defects in the defined shape.** Steps to reproduce · expected vs actual ·
   severity/priority · environment · evidence — then hand off to `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`
   (one document per defect; skill `/report-bug`).

## Test-status markers — the trust contract

Every non-trivial artifact the agent generates carries an explicit, grep-friendly test status in its
comment / accompanying note. The marker strings are canonical English (like the `DONE` tag), regardless
of the project language:

- **`[NOT-TESTED]`** — freshly generated, raw. **Do not trust it.** The LLM "thought" it was right;
  that is not evidence.
- **`[TESTED: <date> · <how it was verified / what was observed>]`** — verified by observation, with
  the evidence named (a run, a render, a recomputation, a check against the source).

**The rules:**

1. **Creating raw content** (a non-trivial block/method/module/section) → write `[NOT-TESTED]` into its
   comment at birth. Commenting is already mandatory (`AGENT_GUIDE.md`); the marker is part of the
   initial comment.
2. **Meeting `[NOT-TESTED]`** (yours or inherited) → do not build on it blindly: plan its verification,
   verify **by observation** (fable-method Step 5: it ran, it rendered, it counted — never inferred from
   reading; and a FUNCTIONAL RUN on the real product, its result read — hygiene does not flip the marker:
   the section on the word "test" above), then flip it to `[TESTED: …]` with the evidence named.
3. **Meeting `[TESTED: …]`** → you may trust it and need not re-test — but keep a grain of doubt
   (principle 1: bugs always exist). If evidence contradicts the marker, the marker is wrong: investigate.
4. **Testing found a defect** → file it (`/report-bug`, method: `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`), fix, re-test,
   and only then mark `[TESTED]`.
5. **A false `[TESTED]`** — the marker present with no verification actually performed — is a fraud;
   `/fable-judge` hunts it like any false completion claim. Never flip a marker without the observation.
6. **Carrier by artifact type:** code → the block/method comment; a document → the section's note; any
   other sphere → the nearest commentable carrier the sphere convention offers.
7. **A FEATURE marker requires a designed set.** `[TESTED]` on a feature is legal only alongside the
   written case set with its covered dimensions (the activities chain above); a single observation
   flips the marker of a single CASE, never of the feature. "It worked once on the happy path" is a
   case-level fact — a marker satisfied by one observation certifies that something was observed,
   while silently claiming the feature was tested: two different statements (origin issue #21).

Markers are the persistent memory of verification: fable-method's Step 5 verifies *in the moment*; the
marker preserves that fact **across sessions**, for future agents and posterity — who else will know the
foundation was load-tested?

## The work produces its own means of checking

"Raw deserves no trust" binds the PRODUCER, not only the checker: building something includes
building what checks it — a test suite, a check-list, test cases, a fixture, a guard. They are
planned WITH the work and land in the SAME step, never "later": verification postponed to a later
step is verification that never happens, and verification that lives only in a session's scratchpad
dies with the session. This is principle 3 (early testing) applied to production rather than to
inspection, and it is why the harness section below exists — the harness is what makes the checking
repeatable once it exists.

The contract in step form — walk it on every non-trivial piece of work:

1. **Name the check while planning the work.** The same task step that builds X names what will
   check X — a suite · a checklist · test cases · a fixture · a guard.
2. **Land both in the same step.** The check enters the repository together with the work — never
   "later", never only in the session's scratchpad.
3. **Prove the check on a broken version** before trusting its green (gate 5 below;
   `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` → Guards). A closed defect is additionally born with the guard for
   its CLASS — that rule lives in `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` ("a fix without a guard is a fix on
   credit") and is not restated here.

The triviality gate applies: a trivial change verified by its one obvious check needs no ceremony
beyond the usual comment and marker. What is never legal is finishing non-trivial work with nothing
that can re-check it.

## An executed run produces its report

The chain above puts test documents BEFORE a run and the trust contract puts a marker INSIDE the
claim — and nothing said what the run itself must leave behind. Field-paid (origin issue #59; the
owner-QA's word: "THERE WAS NO TESTING"): the agent ran a probe twice, wrote `[TESTED]` and "stage
accepted", and the owner could see neither a command, nor a moment, nor what was found. A run that
left no artifact is indistinguishable from a run that never happened. So:

1. **Every executed run leaves a run report** — a live probe, a smoke, a polygon, a functional
   run — in the test-doc home, as a catalog by date:
   `cp .kaif/_testrun-report-template.md testcases/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<work>.md`
   (the home is `testcases/` by default; a project may name another in `.kaif/kaif.json` →
   `testdocs`). The date-first name IS the index: the directory listing is the list of runs, like
   the runs page of a test-management tool — nobody keeps a second list by hand.
2. **Seven fields, none empty** — *Work* (what was tested and against which basis — the case set,
   the plan) · *Contour* (the part of the system and the stand: environment, build, data) · *Runs*
   (how many, WHEN — a timestamp per run — and the exact COMMANDS in code spans) · *Checks* (what
   was verified, case by case, with statuses — opening with two separate lines, `Hygiene:` and
   `Functional run:` — what was walked · on which contour · what was READ, or `NONE`) · *Found* (the defects — or the explicit word "none":
   zero is a finding, silence is not) · *Traces* (where the evidence lives: logs, screenshots,
   artifacts — their paths) · *Verdict* (pass · fail · blocked · partial, with the reason).
3. **A `[TESTED: …]` claim about a run names its report** — the marker carries the report's
   address (`testcases/reports/2026-09-12_polygon.md`) beside the date and the evidence; a claim
   about a run with no report behind it is the "tested without a run report" fraud `/fable-judge`
   hunts.
4. **The linter judges the form, the judge judges the truth.** The optional tool module
   `node .kaif/tools/kaif-testrun-lint.mjs check` (`selftest`) reddens on a missing or empty field,
   on a report outside the date catalog, on *Runs* without a command or a moment, on *Found* that
   is neither a list nor an explicit "none", on a *Verdict* `pass` whose *Checks* carry no
   `Functional run:` line or say `NONE` (hygiene alone is `partial`); when the home has no `reports/` it prints `SKIPPED=3`
   and says so — **an unwritten report is invisible to the linter**; only the judge and the owner
   can ask where it is.

## Green tests ≠ working — the observation gates

A green suite is one observation, not the verdict (principle 1): whole classes of defects are invisible
to every test and obvious to one minute of looking. Before "done" on anything that runs, renders, or
ships, walk the gates that apply:

1. **Live smoke with your eyes on the log.** Run the real process (not only the tests) and read its
   first working cycle in the log — startup, the key operation, no silent error spam.
2. **Self-sufficiency of the shipped artifact.** The image/bundle/package must start in isolation (a
   fresh container/directory) — a build that only works inside your working tree is not shipped.
3. **Domain invariants, before/after.** Before the work, write down the numbers that must not change
   (counts, sums, sizes); after, compare. Comparing two numbers is the one check any session performs
   perfectly — and its signal is among the highest there is.
4. **Countable quality proxies.** Where quality is visual or subjective, find what can be counted
   (animations per screen, panel-opacity checks, bundle growth): a zero on the counter is a stop-defect.
   A proxy never replaces the owner's eye — it catches the zeros *before* the owner has to.
5. **A check that has never failed proves nothing.** Every new guard/check is verified on a broken
   version first (see `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` → Guards); goldens for refactors are byte-exact —
   an empty diff is proof, "the numbers look the same" is not.
   **And the broken version is NAMED — together with its distance from the THREAT.** Reddening a
   guard against *a* broken version is necessary and not sufficient: four field guards in one
   evening were each green and mutation-proven — and each proven against the failure that was
   convenient to simulate (a process death on a digital twin instead of a machine freeze; a
   readback after a CLEAN close instead of a death without one; one warning instead of an
   accumulation; the first step instead of any step). The machine hung, and the fuse built for it
   recorded nothing (origin issue #35). A green mutation over a wrong-threat fixture does not
   withhold confidence — it ISSUES it, falsely. So every guard declares, next to itself, four
   greppable lines, and a guard is DONE only when the last one is no longer `NOT YET`:
   ```
   @guard <name>
   THREAT:         the real event it exists for
   PROVED-AGAINST: what the red run actually did
   GAP:            what the proof does NOT cover — or the word `none`, written after thinking
   ON-REAL-PATH:   where it was seen working on the path the owner actually runs — or `NOT YET`
   ```
   A recorder whose tape must outlive the event it explains declares the same way — `@forensic
   <name>` · `EXPLAINS:` the event · `DURABLE-AT:` when the evidence becomes durable — and `close`,
   `exit`, `trip-only` are rejected values: evidence durable only at a clean ending is not evidence.
   The optional tool module `kaif-guard-lint` (`.kaif/tools/`, `check` / `selftest`) reds on a block
   with a missing field or a rejected `DURABLE-AT`; it fires only on explicit `@guard` / `@forensic`
   markers and never guesses what a guard is.
6. **After a deploy, the gate is production itself, entered as a user.** Sign in by whatever door
   the product offers, walk the real screens, read the console — only then is "deployed" a fact.
   A smoke that only walks public surfaces proves the landing page is alive, not the product: if
   the product has authenticated state, an unauthenticated smoke is NOT evidence about the
   product. (Field-paid: three deploys in one night served an application that did not start at
   all, with every local instrument green — origin issue #18.)
7. **Artifact integrity before shipping.** "It built" and "it is one build" are different claims:
   the shipped bundle carries exactly ONE build identity, asserted mechanically before upload. An
   output directory that is not cleaned between builds ships a mixture of two builds — every
   individual file valid, the SET broken — and mixtures fail in ways no test sees.

Two placement rules, paid for by the same outage: gates 6–7 belong IN THE DEPLOY PATH, not in
prose — one deploy door that runs them itself and fails on any red step (where the agent system
has hooks, deny the raw deploy command; a rule that lives only in a document is a rule the
shipping session skips under pressure). And a post-deploy smoke must be able to FAIL on a dead
product: prove there was something to measure before painting green — a smoke that is greenest
when the product is emptiest is worse than no smoke.

## The agent's stand is not the owner's real world — "done" about production comes after the real world

The agent verifies its work on a clean, freshly built stand — a fresh browser, a clean checkout, a
new user, today's build — and says "done". The owner's world is ACCUMULATED: an old session, a saved
profile, his own edits in the deployed tree, the cache of the previous build — and there it breaks,
while every instrument of the agent was green by construction (KAIF 2.6; origin issue #52; the
owner's word: the agent is OBLIGED to verify on the real world so as not to break what is already in
production). Before the word "done" about anything already in production, the report carries the
difference line:

```
REAL WORLD: accumulated — <what the owner's world already holds: sessions, profiles, data, edits>;
data and machine — <his data, his device, his account>; path — <the door he actually walks>
```

Each item has exactly two legal outcomes — *verified on the real world* (on his state, his data, his
path) or *verified with real state taken from the real world* (seeded from there, never invented).
"not verified there" is not an outcome: it is a STOP — the work stands and names what it waits for
(access · the machine · the owner's word). The one exception is the owner's word about a specific
check that CHANGES his state (writing into his live profile): then the check waits for the owner at
the machine, and "done" is not said. Gates 6–7 tell you to enter production as a user; this rule
tells you WHOSE production — his, with everything it has accumulated. `/fable-judge` hunts "done"
about production without the difference line (the done-without-the-real-world hunt).

## The taste class — when the observer must be human

A subjectively-perceptual acceptance criterion (a perception adjective: beautiful, natural,
pleasant, "feels right") is still verified by observation — but the OBSERVER is the human, by
necessity, not the agent. The agent's role is to PREPARE the observation: produce a mock-up on the
project's own material and hand over an artifact to perceive (`AGENT_GUIDE.md` → "The taste
class"; the homework doc with its two standing fields). The agent's own "sounds good to me" is not
a verification and never flips a marker; the owner's recorded verdict is.

## How this composes with the rest of KAIF

- **`REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md`** — shapes what is REQUIRED before anything is made; this framework
  verifies what was MADE against it. Principle 3 (early testing) is executed at the requirements
  stage by that canon; bugs are what is born where the two meet (`BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`). The
  boundary does not close the door on requirements analysis: deriving the test basis FROM the
  requirements is step 1 of the activities chain here.
- **fable-method** — Step 5 (verify by observation) is HOW a single check is performed; this framework
  says WHAT must carry a status and how trust propagates. The triviality gate still applies: a trivial
  change verified by its one obvious check needs no ceremony beyond its normal comment.
- **`/fable-judge`** — treats test-status markers as claims: a `[TESTED]` it cannot reproduce is REFUTED.
- **The guard-declaration block as a guard** — the optional tool module `kaif-guard-lint`
  (`.kaif/tools/`) runs gate 5's second half mechanically over explicit `@guard` / `@forensic` /
  `@fork` markers; advisory, `SKIPPED=3` when a tree declares nothing.
- **The run-report form as a guard** — the optional tool module `kaif-testrun-lint` (`.kaif/tools/`)
  judges the seven fields and the date catalog of "An executed run produces its report"; advisory,
  `SKIPPED=3` when the test-doc home has no `reports/`.
- **`BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`** — where testing's findings go (one doc per defect; 3 attempts → research).
- **Spheres** (`.kaif/spheres/`) — define the sphere's evidence, verification-by-observation meaning, and
  fraud table; principle 6 lives there.
- **The harness** — invest in tooling that makes verification observable and deterministic
  (`AGENT_GUIDE.md` → Test harness); eyeballing is not testing.

*Grounding: the seven principles and the activities chain (test basis → design techniques →
documentation → execution → defect reporting) are the ISTQB canon (istqb.org; ru: testbase.ru) —
distilled here for an AI agent across all spheres; the run report is the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 test
execution log and test completion report distilled to seven fields. The activities section, the
feature/case marker rule, gates 6–7 and the run report were paid for in the field: origin issues #21,
#18 and #59.*
